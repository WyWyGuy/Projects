<h2>A Place I Would Like to Visit</h2>

<p>Europe. It has a lot of big cities and cool 
tourist attractions. This is the reason I would like 
to visit it.</p>

<h2>A Person I Admire<br/>(Past or present)</h2>

<p>I admire my older brother because he is always busy and
 gets almost no time to have fun. He is very busy, but is able 
 to do everything he needs to.</p>
